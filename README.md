# Matcha

Dating websites are a market of love. One can “prospect” and “present” him or herself
with the goal of meeting the person with whom he or she will develop a relationship. If
most meeting sites known to the public have a widespread audience, some sites, following
a logical niche strat- egy have specialized in some very specific domain, some are very
indecent.

## Registration and Signing-in

 -   The app allow a user to register asking at least an email address, a last name, a first name and a password that is protected.
 -  The user able to connect with his/her email and password. He/She able to receive an email allowing him/her to re-initialize his/her password should the first one be forgotten and disconnect with 1 click from any pages on the site.

When a user consults a profile, it appear in his/her visit history.

The user also able to:
 -  If he has at least one picture “like” another user. When two people “like” each other, we will say that they are “connected” and are now able to chat. If the current user does not have a picture, he/she cannot complete this action.
 -  Check the “fame rating”.
 -  See if the user is online, and if not see the date and time of the last connection.
 -  Report the user as a “fake account”.
 -  Block the user. A blocked user won’t appear anymore in the research results and won’t generate additional notifications.
